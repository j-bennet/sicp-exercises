; Selected exercises:

; 3.13
; 3.18

; The above two exercises are tricky and will require some thought. They'll
; also be good practice for exploring mutability in scheme.

; The other sections of the chapter cover queues, tables, and a digital circuit 
; simulator. They are all great practice but not required for discussion or
; for learning the basic concepts from the chapter, so it'll be up to all of
; you if you'd like to spend any time on them. We can definitely still discuss
; them at the meeting.
