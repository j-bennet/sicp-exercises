; The following procedure implements the decoding algorithm.
; It takes as arguments a list of zeros and ones, together with a
; Huffman tree.

; Exercise 2.67.  Define an encoding tree and a sample message:

(define sample-tree
  (make-code-tree (make-leaf 'A 4)
                  (make-code-tree
                   (make-leaf 'B 2)
                   (make-code-tree (make-leaf 'D 1)
                                   (make-leaf 'C 1)))))

(define sample-message '(0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0))

; Use the decode procedure to decode the message, and give the
; result.
