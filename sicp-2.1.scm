; Exercise 2.2.  Consider the problem of representing line segments in a plane. 
; Each segment is represented as a pair of points: a starting point and an ending point. 
; Define a constructor make-segment and selectors start-segment and end-segment 
; that define the representation of segments in terms of points. Furthermore, 
; a point can be represented as a pair of numbers: the x coordinate and the y coordinate. 
; Accordingly, specify a constructor make-point and selectors x-point and y-point that 
; define this representation.

; Exercise 2.3.  Implement a representation for rectangles in a plane. (Hint: You may want

; Exercise 2.5.  Show that we can represent pairs of nonnegative integers using only numbers
; and arithmetic operations if we represent the pair a and b as the integer that is the product 
; 2a 3b. Give the corresponding definitions of the procedures cons, car, and cdr.

; Exercise 2.6.  In case representing pairs as procedures wasn't mind-boggling enough, 
; consider that, in a language that can manipulate procedures, we can get by without numbers 
; (at least insofar as nonnegative integers are concerned) by implementing 0 and the operation 
; of adding 1 as

(define zero (lambda (f) 
               (lambda (x)

; Exercise 2.7. Define selectors upper-bound and lower-bound to complete the implementation.

; Exercise 2.8.  Using reasoning analogous to Alyssa's, describe how the difference of two 
; intervals may be computed. Define a corresponding subtraction procedure, called sub-interval.
(define (sub-interval x y)
  (make-interval (- (lower-bound x) (lower-bound y))
                 (- (upper-bound x) (upper-bound y))))

;Exercise 2.9.  The width of an interval is half of the difference between its upper and lower 
; bounds. The width is a measure of the uncertainty of the number specified by the interval.
; For some arithmetic operations the width of the result of combining two intervals is a
; function only of the widths of the argument intervals, whereas for others the width of the
; combination is not a function of the widths of the argument intervals. Show that the width
; of the sum (or difference) of two intervals is a function only of the widths of the intervals
; being added (or subtracted). Give examples to show that this is not true for multiplication
; or division.
;
; if w = (ub - lg)
; then w of (lb1 + lb2), (ub1 + ub2) = (ub1 + ub2) - (lb1 + lb2)
;                                    = (ub1 - lb1) + (ub2 - lbs)
;                                    = w1 + w2

;Exercise 2.10.  Ben Bitdiddle, an expert systems programmer, looks over Alyssa's shoulder
; and comments that it is not clear what it means to divide by an interval that spans zero.
; Modify Alyssa's code to check for this condition and to signal an error if it occurs.

;Exercise 2.11.  In passing, Ben also cryptically comments: ``By testing the signs of
; the endpoints of the intervals, it is possible to break mul-interval into nine cases,
; only one of which requires more than two multiplications.'' Rewrite this procedure
; using Ben's suggestion.

;After debugging her program, Alyssa shows it to a potential user, who complains that her
; program solves the wrong problem. He wants a program that can deal with numbers represented
; as a center value and an additive tolerance; for example, he wants to work with intervals
; such as 3.5Â± 0.15 rather than [3.35, 3.65]. Alyssa returns to her desk and fixes
; this problem by supplying an alternate constructor and alternate selectors:

(define (make-center-width c w)
  (make-interval (- c w) (+ c w)))

(define (center i)
  (/ (+ (lower-bound i) (upper-bound i)) 2))

(define (width i)
  (/ (- (upper-bound i) (lower-bound i)) 2))


; Unfortunately, most of Alyssa's users are engineers. Real engineering situations usually
; involve measurements with only a small uncertainty, measured as the ratio of the width
; of the interval to the midpoint of the interval. Engineers usually specify percentage
; tolerances on the parameters of devices, as in the resistor specifications given earlier.

; Exercise 2.12.  Define a constructor make-center-percent that takes a center and a percentage
; tolerance and produces the desired interval. You must also define a selector percent that
; produces the percentage tolerance for a given interval. The center selector is the same
; as the one shown above.
(define (make-center-percent c p)
  (let ((w (* c p)))
       (make-interval (- c w) (+ c w))))

(define (percent i)
  (- 1 (/ (lower-bound i) (center i))))

; Exercise 2.13.  Show that under the assumption of small percentage tolerances there is
; a simple formula for the approximate percentage tolerance of the product of two intervals
; in terms of the tolerances of the factors. You may simplify the problem by assuming
; that all numbers are positive.

; (r1 * r2) / (r1 + r2)
(define (par1 r1 r2)
  (div-interval (mul-interval r1 r2)
                (add-interval r1 r2)))

; 1 / (1 / r1 + 1 / r2)
(define (par2 r1 r2)
  (let ((one (make-interval 1 1))) 
    (div-interval one
                  (add-interval (div-interval one r1)
                                (div-interval one r2)))))

;Lem complains that Alyssa's program gives different answers for the two ways of computing. This is a
; serious complaint.

;Exercise 2.14.  Demonstrate that Lem is right. Investigate the behavior of the system on a variety
; of arithmetic expressions. Make some intervals A and B, and use them in computing the expressions
; A/A and A/B. You will get the most insight by using intervals whose width is a small percentage
; of the center value. Examine the results of the computation in center-percent form (see exercise 2.12).

;Exercise 2.15.  Eva Lu Ator, another user, has also noticed the different intervals computed by different
; but algebraically equivalent expressions. She says that a formula to compute with intervals using
; Alyssa's system will produce tighter error bounds if it can be written in such a form that no variable
; that represents an uncertain number is repeated. Thus, she says, par2 is a ``better'' program for
; parallel resistances than par1. Is she right? Why?

;Exercise 2.16.  Explain, in general, why equivalent algebraic expressions may lead to different answers.
; Can you devise an interval-arithmetic package that does not have this shortcoming, or is this task
; impossible? (Warning: This problem is very difficult.)
